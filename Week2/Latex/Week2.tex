\section{lists and recursion}
Write a script that takes an integer N, and outputs all bit-strings of length N as lists. For example: $3 -> [0,0,0], [0,0,1],[0,1,0],[0,1,1],[1,0,0],[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[1,1,1]$. As a sanity check, remember that there are $2^N$ such lists.

Do not use the bin-function in Python. Do not use strings at all. Try to solve this using only lists, integers, if-statements, loops, functions and the map function (you donâ€™t need all these things).

\textbf{Solution:}
Line 5 computes the sequences on the subproblems for smaller $N$. The method then loops through these lines and creates the extensions by extending the sequences with $0$'s and $1$'s.
\begin{framed}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Python, numbers=left]
def bits(N):
    if N == 1:
        return [[0], [1]]
    else:
        l = bits(N-1)
        l_all = []
        for i in range(len(l)):
            l0 = []
            l1 = []
            l0.extend(l[i])  # extend is used to avoid making a list of lists, but instead appending the elements of the list to the new list
            l0.extend([0])
            l1.extend(l[i])
            l1.extend([1])
            l_all.append(l0)
            l_all.append(l1)

        return l_all

N = 3
s = bits(N)

print(s)
print(len(s))

\section{bag of words}
Write a script that takes this file (from this Kaggle competition), extracts the \texttt{request\_text} field from each dictionary in the list, and construct a bag of words representation of the string (string to count-list).

There should be one row pr. text. The matrix should be $N x M$ where $N$ is the number of texts and $M$ is the number of distinct words in all the texts.  The result should be a list of lists ($[[0,1,0],[1,0,0]]$ is a matrix with two rows and three columns).

\textbf{Solution:}
The following scripts performs the task with comments on segments. 
\begin{framed}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Python, numbers=left]
from time import time
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
plt.close("all")

# Load the data
with open('Week2/pizza-train.json', 'r') as file:
    lines = [line.split() for line in file.readlines()]

# Get request_text's
lines = [line[1:] for line in lines 
	     if line[0] == '"request_text":']
n_lines = len(lines)

# Find all distinct words in vocabulary
words = set()
idx = 0
for line in lines:
    text = line
    words.update(text)

# Make a word-list and mapping to indices
words = sorted(list(words))
word2idx = {word: idx for idx, word in enumerate(words)}
n_words = len(words)

# Bag-of-words list of lists
bow = [[0] * n_words for _ in range(n_lines)]
for line_nr, line in enumerate(lines):
    text = line
    bow_row = bow[line_nr]
    for word in text:
        ix = word2idx[word]
        bow_row[ix] = 1
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Make Your Own}
Make your own exercise to teach people how to use python dictionaries. Provide a solution for the exercise. 

\textit{Use dictionaries to speed up the recursive function from exercise 1, e.g. when using recursive functions with a large number of repetitive recalculations, e.g. a large $N$ in this case. Specifically, build a dictionary called bits\_dict into the function, so that all the lists for values <= the biggest N that has been calculated can be obtained from the dictionary by calling bits\_dict[value $<=$ the biggest calculated so far]. Last but not least, think about why a dictionary can speed up recursive functions.}

\textbf{Solution:}
The code-snippet below shows a solution to the exercise. Line 3 defines the dictionary and initializes it with the base case where $N=1$. When given a number, \texttt{bits} first check whether it already knows the solution to the problem and returns this problem if so. Otherwise it creates a list by extracting all lists from the subproblem for $N-1$ and combining these with $0$ and $1$ (lines 7-11). 

\begin{framed}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Python, numbers=left]
import time

bits_dict = {1: [[0], [1]]}

def bits(n):
    if n not in bits_dict:
        l_all = [
            [val, *li]
            for val in [0, 1]
            for li in bits(n - 1)
        ]

        # Store subproblem result
        bits_dict[n] = l_all

    return bits_dict[n]

N = 22
start = time()
s = bits(N)
end = time()

print("Sequences created : {}".format(len(s)))
print("Sequences expected: {}".format(2**N))
print("Time for creation: {:.2f}s".format(end-start))
